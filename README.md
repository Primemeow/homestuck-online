# Homestuck Online

## THIS IS DEPRECATED BECAUSE OF THE HOMESTUCK COLLECTION'S NEW BROWSER MODULE

A very barebones Homestuck reader, that uses Ruffle to play the original swfs. This is currently and will likely forever be missing a lot of features. There are no custom page styles, no headers, no links, etc. just a barebones Homestuck reader that works somewhat fine up to the Intermission when things get crazier. Probably not worth bothering with this. Still, a somewhat fun practice project.

As a requirement of the Unofficial Homestuck Collection's GNU General Public License v3.0, which is somehow the license for a project dedicated to duplicating a copyrighted work, this is also licensed under the same terms, which you can check in the LICENSE file.
